# Hostinger Deployment

This project is now prepared for a standard Hostinger Node.js deployment.

This is the only documented production deployment target for the repo. Remove any old non-Hostinger production examples from active environment files and OAuth settings.

Assumption:
- You are deploying to Hostinger Node hosting or a Hostinger VPS.
- You are not deploying to PHP-only shared hosting.

## Required Runtime

- Node.js 20 or newer
- MongoDB Atlas or another persistent MongoDB
- Writable app directory for `data/` and `storage/uploads/`

## Required Environment Variables

Minimum production env:

```env
MONGODB_URI=
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=
NEXTAUTH_URL=https://your-domain.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=https://your-domain.com
ADMIN_LOGIN_ID=admin
ADMIN_PASSWORD_HASH=
```

Example for the current production site:

```env
NEXTAUTH_URL=https://lokswami.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=https://lokswami.com
```

Required if uploads are enabled:

```env
DIGITALOCEAN_SPACES_ACCESS_KEY=
DIGITALOCEAN_SPACES_SECRET_KEY=
DIGITALOCEAN_SPACES_BUCKET=
DIGITALOCEAN_SPACES_REGION=sgp1
DIGITALOCEAN_SPACES_CDN_BASE_URL=https://your-bucket.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com
EPAPER_STORAGE_UPLOADS_BASE_DIR=storage/uploads
EPAPER_FORCE_STORAGE=1
```

The same DigitalOcean Spaces variables power story videos, story images, thumbnails, and e-paper assets.


Optional if you use Google login:

```env
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=
NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=
ADMIN_EMAILS=
```

Optional AI / OCR:

```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=
OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-4o-mini
OCR_SPACE_API_KEY=
OCR_SPACE_LANGUAGE=hin
GEMINI_API_KEY=
GEMINI_TTS_MODEL=gemini-2.5-flash-preview-tts
GEMINI_TTS_VOICE=Sulafat
```

Optional leadership report delivery:

```env
LEADERSHIP_REPORT_CRON_SECRET=
LEADERSHIP_REPORT_FROM_EMAIL=
RESEND_API_KEY=
RESEND_FROM_EMAIL=
```

Optional Hostinger release state override:

```env
HOSTINGER_STATE_DIR=
```

## Google OAuth Production Redirect

If Google login is enabled, add these in Google Cloud Console:

- Authorized JavaScript origin: `https://your-domain.com`
- Authorized redirect URI: `https://your-domain.com/api/auth/callback/google`

If you are using the current production domain, that means:

- Authorized JavaScript origin: `https://lokswami.com`
- Authorized redirect URI: `https://lokswami.com/api/auth/callback/google`

## Build And Start Commands

Use these commands on the server:

```bash
npm ci
npm run build
npm start
```

Do not replace the start command with `next start` or `node .next/standalone/server.js`.
Those paths bypass the managed Hostinger release overlap and can bring back stale-chunk 404s after deploys.

Equivalent explicit Hostinger aliases still work:

```bash
npm run build:hostinger
npm run start:hostinger
```

Recommended release flow:

1. Update production env values in Hostinger.
2. Run `npm run verify:prod-env`.
3. Run `npm ci`.
4. Run `npm run build`.
5. Restart with `npm start` or the Hostinger app restart control.
6. Run the live deploy verification before calling the deploy complete.
7. Run the signed-in manual checks before calling admin healthy.

Rollback command:

```bash
npm run rollback:hostinger
npm run start:hostinger
```

That marks the previous prepared release as pending and then promotes it on restart.

What `build:hostinger` does:

- builds the Next.js app into `.next`
- snapshots the new `.next/static` output
- prepares a versioned standalone release under `.hostinger/releases/<build-id>`
- copies `public/` into that prepared release
- merges a short overlap window of older hashed `/_next/static/*` assets into the new release so stale HTML can still resolve its chunks during rollout
- rebuilds a shared `.hostinger/shared-next-static` bundle so any managed release can answer recent hashed asset requests
- records the prepared release in `.hostinger/release-state.json`

On Hostinger Git deployments, the scripts now default that managed `.hostinger` state directory to a persistent path outside `.builds/source/repository/` so static overlap can survive fresh repository checkouts between deploys.

What `start:hostinger` does now:

- promotes the most recently prepared release to current only when the process starts
- starts the promoted release behind a small proxy that serves `/_next/static/*` and `/__next_static__/*` from the shared overlap-aware bundle
- prunes older release directories after promotion
- keeps a wider default overlap of older hashed `/_next/static/*` assets so stale tabs can recover after deploys

This avoids the old failure mode where an in-place build deleted the currently running `.next/standalone/.next/static` files before the new release was fully live, and it also keeps mixed-release requests from turning chunk misses into `text/plain` 404s when Hostinger briefly routes HTML and asset requests to different release generations.

Important for Hostinger auto-deploy:

- the repo default `build` script now performs the Hostinger release preparation step
- the repo default `start` script now launches the Hostinger release wrapper
- this keeps Hostinger's "Build and output settings: Default" path compatible with this repo

## Hostinger hPanel Node App

Recommended settings:

- Application root: project root
- Build command: `npm run build`
- Start command: `npm start`
- Node version: `20` or newer

After deploy, verify:

- homepage loads
- `/api/health` returns `status: ok`
- admin login works
- guest access to admin pages and admin APIs is blocked
- uploads work
- Google sign-in works if enabled
- article, e-paper, breaking news, and AI listen features generate Gemini audio
- `npm run test:tts-smoke -- https://your-domain.com` passes
- leadership report schedules can run from `/admin/analytics`
- the due-run endpoint works with the configured cron secret

## Hostinger VPS

Typical flow:

```bash
npm ci
npm run build
PORT=3000 npm start
```

Then reverse proxy with Nginx to your domain.

## Writable Paths

This app writes runtime data to:

- `data/`
- `storage/uploads/`

Recommended for Hostinger GitHub deploys:

- set `EPAPER_FORCE_STORAGE=1`
- this keeps e-paper assets and breaking-news audio out of `public/uploads`, which is not durable across versioned release deploys

If Hostinger restricts writes inside the app root, set:

```env
EPAPER_STORAGE_UPLOADS_BASE_DIR=/absolute/path/to/writable/storage/uploads
```

## Important Notes

- Do not rely on local JSON data as your primary production database.
- Use MongoDB in production.
- If production uploads are important, configure DigitalOcean Spaces.
- Keep `NEXTAUTH_URL` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` on the same final domain.
- Regenerate `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` only if you are okay invalidating sessions.
- Do not delete `.hostinger/` between deploys. It stores the active release plus recent static snapshots for safe chunk overlap.
- Do not delete `.hostinger/shared-next-static/`. The startup proxy uses it as the shared asset surface for both `/_next/static/*` and `/__next_static__/*`.
- If you need to tune overlap or release retention, set `HOSTINGER_STATIC_OVERLAP_RELEASES` and `HOSTINGER_RELEASE_RETENTION`.
- If your Hostinger setup needs a different persistent writable location, set `HOSTINGER_STATE_DIR`. Relative values resolve from the project root.

## Quick Smoke Test

Before deployment or restart:

1. Run `npm run verify:prod-env`

After deployment:

1. Run `npm run verify:deploy -- https://your-domain.com`
2. Complete the manual checks in `DEPLOY_SMOKE_CHECKLIST.md` and `ADMIN_RUNTIME_CHECKLIST.md`

`verify:deploy` runs all three:

- `npm run test:smoke -- https://your-domain.com`
- `npm run test:tts-smoke -- https://your-domain.com`
- `npm run test:admin-runtime -- https://your-domain.com`

The smoke script now validates HTML asset integrity for `/signin`, `/main`, and `/main/epaper` by parsing the live HTML and checking that every referenced JS/CSS file under `/_next/static/*` returns `200` with the correct content type.

## Leadership Report Cron

If you want daily, weekly, or monthly leadership briefings to run automatically:

1. Set:
   - `LEADERSHIP_REPORT_CRON_SECRET`
   - `LEADERSHIP_REPORT_FROM_EMAIL` if using email delivery
   - `RESEND_API_KEY` and `RESEND_FROM_EMAIL` if using email delivery
2. Configure schedules in `/admin/analytics`
3. Add a Hostinger cron command like:

```bash
wget -qO- "https://your-domain.com/api/admin/analytics/briefing-schedules/run-due?secret=YOUR_SECRET"
```

Recommended cron frequency:

- every `15 minutes`
